This is a JavaScript triangle arbitrage bot that utilizes AAVE for flashloans / flashswap if settings are selected for Network ethereum or Polygon. If you select the binance smart chain "BNB" didn't utilizes pancakeswap flashswap function for loaning. This is very easy to deploy and run simply put the settings in the config.js file by editing it in a text editor. Then you simply open index.html in your web-browser and it will start up looking for arbitrage opportunity. Keep in mind if you have zero balance in your wallet that you provided in config.js it will never find arbitrage opportunity because it's based on the gas fee they are able to provide. To execute the arbitrage when found it takes a large flashloan to maximize your profit and does not use any of your funds besides gas fee to execute the arbitrage trade.
